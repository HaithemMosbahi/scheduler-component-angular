# scheduler-component-angular

The [scheduler component](https://github.com/HaithemMosbahi/scheduler-component-angular.git) is a web component that makes it easy to create highly customizable calendar to manage and schedule events. The scheduler is built using polymer 2.0 which uses ES 6 and implements custom element specification V1.
